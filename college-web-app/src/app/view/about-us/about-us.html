      <h2>About Our Website</h2>
      <p>The new college website is designed with clean and modern HTML5 structure and elegant CSS3 styling.</p>
      <p>Its homepage features a large banner with the college logo and a welcoming message to students and visitors.</p>
      <p>The navigation bar at the top provides quick links to Admissions, Departments, Courses, and Contact pages.</p>
      <p>CSS flexbox and grid layouts are used to keep all sections responsive and well-aligned on any device.</p>
      <p>The About Us page introduces the college’s mission, vision, and history with soft background colors and readable fonts.</p>
      <p>The Departments section displays cards for each department, styled with hover effects using CSS transitions.</p>
      <p>A separate page lists all courses, using tables and colored headings for clarity and organization.</p>
      <p>The Contact page includes a simple HTML form for inquiries, styled with rounded input fields and subtle shadows.</p>
      <p>The entire website uses a consistent color theme — blue and white — symbolizing trust and knowledge.</p>
      <p>With proper HTML semantics and CSS responsiveness, the college website looks professional, accessible, and user-friendly.</p>
